# beat_tracker

The jupyter notebooks in this repo propose how to design a beat-tracking system. Results have been evaluated using the [Ballroom dataset](http://mtg.upf.edu/ismir2004/contest/tempoContest/node5.html).

This is a basic beat tracker, relying on a combination of onset detection algorithms, periodicity of onsets, and frequency analysis. It is acknowledged that there is *much* room for improvement. Just ask ;)

Documentation for the application of this research can be provided upon request.
